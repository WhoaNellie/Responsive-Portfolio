            Nellie is a former Math teacher who is attempting to write a bio that takes up an appropriate amount of space on the page. She recently graduated from the University of Arizona with a degree in Psychology and a Thematic Minor in Mathematics and Technology. "Thematic" here not meaning that it was achieved with any amount of stage talent, but that it was a curriculum cobbled together with an advisor in a single afternoon. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Most notably, Nellie was President of Mock Trial at the University of Arizona and currently acts as a Mentor to the program when she is not making this website or job hunting. She advises them on the Midlands Rules of Evidence, expert witness testimony, funny accents, and crying (both on and off the witness stand).
        </p>
        <p>
            Nellie became interested in web development when she accidentally opened up the page source of an early 2000's website and saw an not-quite-age-appropriate ASCII drawing commented into the page.
